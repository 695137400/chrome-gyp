What arguments do I need to give to `gyptest.py` to fix this, if there is a practical way to do so?",

      "message": "This is, by and large, a Python 2 project, that never grew up to Python 3 because Chrome stopped using it before we made the transition.\n\nThere have been changes to implement some form of Python 3 support over the years, but I don’t think anything has broken Python 2 support, and given that mac_tool would only have worked in Python 2 until now (as you point out), I’d be reluctant to suddenly break it.\n\nIt does appear that this proposed patch would break mac_tool under Python 2.\n\nGiven all of the above, I’m also curious about what’s using this or prompting this that the patch is suddenly being proposed.",
