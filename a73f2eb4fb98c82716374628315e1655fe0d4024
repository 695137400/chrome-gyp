I don\u0027t doubt that you found it necessary, but I can get by with both VS 2015 and VS 2017 without this. Primarily, I don\u0027t want this change to break something else that was relying on the previous behavior.\n\nI don\u0027t know where your error snippet came from. Was it a GYP test? If not, this may need a test to help define the behavior.",
