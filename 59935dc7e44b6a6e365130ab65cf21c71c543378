      "message": "This style is really unconventional in GYP for os.path. We’re quite used to seeing os.path.join, os.path.normpath, etc. “join” and “exists” are particularly tricky names to import into the global namespace because without the “os.path” context, their function is about as ambiguous as possible.",
